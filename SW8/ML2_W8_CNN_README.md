# ðŸ“– README â€“ Machine Learning 2, SW 8: Convolutional Neural Networks

## Overview

This README summarizes the key content from **Week 8 (SW 8)** of the Machine Learning 2 course (FS 2025), based on the lecture slides provided by Dr. Elena Gavagnin. The focus is on **classic deep learning methods for image data**, especially **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**.

## Topics Covered

âœ… Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) introduction and TensorFlow/Keras implementation  
âœ… Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) basics and architecture  
âœ… Famous CNN architectures (e.g., LeNet, AlexNet, ImageNet)  
âœ… Transfer Learning and Fine Tuning with pre-trained layers  
âœ… Visual data preparation (image shapes, channels, preprocessing)  
âœ… Optimizers (SGD, Adam, others)  
âœ… Regularization techniques: L2, L1, Dropout  
âœ… Early Stopping to avoid overfitting  
âœ… TensorBoard for live visualization and tracking

## Main Hands-on Task (Exercise)

- Adapt the MNIST example (28x28 grayscale) to CIFAR-10 (32x32 RGB).
- Modify the input layer and architecture to handle 3 channels (RGB).
- Train and evaluate performance.
- Compare results to MNIST.
- Use TensorBoard to monitor training.
- Apply regularization techniques.
- Investigate optimizers beyond SGD.

## Notes

- **Input Shapes**: MNIST (28,28,1), CIFAR-10 (32,32,3)  
- **Output Classes**: 10 for both datasets
- **Common Activation Functions**: ReLU (hidden layers), Softmax (output layer)
- **Loss Function**: Sparse Categorical Crossentropy (for integer labels)
