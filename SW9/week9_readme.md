# ðŸ“¦ Week 9 README â€“ Machine Learning 2 (FS2025)

Welcome to **Week 9** of ML2: focused on **Transfer Learning and CNNs for Images**!

This README gives you a quick guide on how to navigate the materials and what to focus on as you prepare for your hackathon-style exam.

## ðŸ“‚ Included Materials

- **Slides** â†’ Overview of key concepts (CNNs, Transfer Learning, Famous Architectures, Vision Transformers)
- **Exercises** â†’ Jupyter notebooks on:
    - Transfer learning with Keras CNNs
    - Fine-tuning models
    - Hugging Face Vision Transformers (ViT)
    - Image data preparation and augmentation

## ðŸ“Œ Focus Areas

âœ… Understand **what a CNN is** and **why itâ€™s used** for image data.  
âœ… Know **when to freeze or fine-tune layers** in a pre-trained network.  
âœ… Practice **building and training models using TensorFlow/Keras**.  
âœ… Familiarize yourself with **Vision Transformers** and the Hugging Face API.  
âœ… Apply **data augmentation** techniques for better generalization.

## ðŸ›  Tools Youâ€™ll Use

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| TensorFlow / Keras | Build and train CNN models |
| TensorFlow Hub | Import pretrained models |
| Hugging Face Transformers | Fine-tune ViT models |
| Matplotlib | Visualize data, training curves |
| Scikit-learn | Evaluation metrics |

## ðŸ’¡ Best Prep Tips

- Work through the exercises and understand **each code block**.
- Check the **cheatsheet.md** file for ready-to-use reference code.
- Practice **running training loops**, **adjusting hyperparameters**, and **evaluating models**.
- Review the slides for **theoretical context** and architecture details.
- Make sure your **hardware is set up** (especially GPU access) before the hackathon.

## ðŸ“‹ Before the Exam, Double-Check

âœ… Python environment set up?  
âœ… TensorFlow, Keras, and Transformers libraries installed?  
âœ… Notebook files run end-to-end without errors?  
âœ… CUDA/GPU enabled (if available)?  
âœ… Cheatsheet printed or accessible offline?

Good luck! Youâ€™ve got this ðŸ’ª
